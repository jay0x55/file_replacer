# File Replacer

this script can replace your files text but the whole folder which means all files in a Folder

what u need:

- config file
- files folder path to submit changes
- run the script

config:

> the orginal
> text & the replaced text;
> text & hello;
> so thats it & OK;

actully u should use `&` char to put orginal text and replace text then u should use `;` at the end of it

also u can check `example_conf.txt` and `test` directory to check how config works

### thats it
it's just for fun hope u enjoy it
